# nonomaker
uses Python and pysimplegui (and some other things specifically for the imported solver) 

GUI to make a nonogram

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonogram

can: pick canvas size, blocksize, max waiting time for solving; draw a nonogram, check if it's solvable, and export as either the solution or the blank version (so the clues with a blank canvas)

All necessary functions are in the main file, no need to download the rest. I do suggest downloading the "Icon___.png" files because the alt version is less pretty. The "NonoClueGenerator" DOES still work as a standalone (using .txt files for instance), but requires some cleanup - it prints the clues with the nonogram itself in the terminal.

to do: some QoL stuff like different themes
